<!-- I hope that I did this right. I am defintely open to suggestions if there are some things that aren't right.

Okay. 
I what I see in my mind is a page with a very basic backgound as that isn't my main focus(maybe if time permits). There's a simple title that basically says something like cinema review editor. There will be a button for each different API request that will correspond to the movie page(example: delete one movie review button that will make the delete API request). 
I will have about 4 movies that will come with: title,rating score,and review(I believe i will have an nested array that will hold all movies and arrays for each movie)

As far as what my Req, Res will look like I got kind of confused with that just a little. If I was to make a guess on what that means.
The request would be the URL depending on what request is made. So app.get('/movies',(req,res))
app.get('/movies/:SingleMovieId')
I am going to spend sone time looking that information up to see what I can find and what I can add to it

What is the Json response look like?
 Use events app as a model(structur, set-up)
